Each row in the risk register typically includes:

- **Risk ID** â€“ Unique identifier
- **Risk Description** â€“ Summary of the threat or issue
- **Likelihood (1â€“5)** â€“ Probability of occurrence
- **Impact (1â€“5)** â€“ Severity if realized
- **Risk Score** â€“ Product of likelihood and impact
- **Control Mapping** â€“ Linked to ISO 27001, NIST, CIS, etc.
- **Mitigation Strategy** â€“ Actions to reduce risk
- **Risk Owner** â€“ Person/Team responsible
- **Status** â€“ Open, In Progress, Accepted, Mitigated
