# ðŸ¤– AI-Powered GRC Integration â€“ Use Cases & Lab Ideas

This section outlines practical ways to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) functions using real-world use cases and hands-on GitHub portfolio ideas.

---

## 1. AI-Powered Risk Scoring

**Use Case**: Dynamically prioritize risks based on impact, likelihood, and evolving threat intelligence.

**Tools/Ideas**:
- Model (Excel + GPT logic or Python + OpenAI API) auto-scores risks from risk registers.
- Inputs: Asset type, control maturity, vulnerability severity, business function.
- Outputs: Suggested **Risk Score** (Low/Med/High/Critical) + rationale.

**Portfolio Project**: `ai-risk-scorer.py` â€“ Parses CSV of risks and suggests scores using GPT or rule-based logic.

---

## 2. Automated Control Mapping

**Use Case**: Map internal policies or vendor SOC 2/ISO docs to NIST, ISO 27001, CIS Controls.

**Tools/Ideas**:
- Upload policy documents and use LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to map controls.
- Compare vendor audit reports to your internal GRC control library.

**Portfolio Project**: `control_mapper_AI.md` â€“ Upload vendor doc â†’ output mapped controls + status.

---

## 3. Continuous Control Monitoring

**Use Case**: AI monitors system logs or security tools (e.g., Qualys/Splunk) to flag control failures in real-time.

**Tools/Ideas**:
- Integrate Splunk with GPT to summarize anomalies.
- Auto-flag expired certs, missing patches from Qualys or compliance data.

**Portfolio Project**: `compliance_monitor_bot.py` â€“ Flags failed controls, emails a report.

## 4. Audit Evidence Assistant

**Use Case**: Automate audit evidence collection/classification based on control requirements.

**Tools/Ideas**:
- Use GPT to search OneDrive/SharePoint/email to extract evidence related to access control or logging.
- Automate using Python or Power Automate.

**Portfolio Project**: `audit_evidence_helper.md` â€“ Select audit type + framework â†’ AI-generated checklist & emails.

---

## 5. AI-Powered Policy Review

**Use Case**: Auto-check policies for missing clauses, outdated language, or framework mismatches.

**Tools/Ideas**:
- GPT parses `InfoSecPolicy.docx` and detects:
  - Missing clauses (e.g., encryption, MFA)
  - Outdated references (e.g., software, laws)

**Portfolio Project**: `policy_review_bot.md` â€“ Upload policy â†’ receive AI feedback.

---

## 6. Smart Compliance Dashboards

**Use Case**: Generate visual summaries with AI-generated insights on compliance posture.

**Tools/Ideas**:
- Power BI + GPT summaries
- Markdown dashboards with AI annotations

**Portfolio Project**: `ai_compliance_summary.md` â€“ Parse Excel â†’ generate executive compliance summary.
