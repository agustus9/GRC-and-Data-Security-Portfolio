# Regular Expression (Regex) Library

Welcome to the **Regex Library** — a curated collection of regular expressions and hands-on labs developed to support **Microsoft Purview**, **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**, **sensitive data detection**, and broader **GRC use cases**.

This library is structured to help GRC professionals, Data Security Engineers, and Security Analysts **design, test, and implement** regex-based patterns for custom sensitive information types and real-world compliance workflows.

## 🎯 Purpose

This library serves to:
- Support the creation of **custom Sensitive Information Types** in Microsoft Purview
- Provide **regex templates** for detecting financial, healthcare, and personal identifiers (e.g., SSNs, credit cards, IBANs)
- Offer **reusable regex patterns** for audit readiness, data classification, and policy enforcement
- Enable regex testing and learning through **lab-based exercises** and practical walkthroughs

---

## 🔍 Sample Use Cases

- Detecting improperly stored **Social Security Numbers (SSNs)** in SharePoint files
- Creating custom patterns for **international passport numbers**
- Testing DLP policies with **bank account number formats** in test datasets
- Auditing sensitive data fields in exported CSVs using regex matchers

---

## 🧪 How to Use

- Browse the `patterns/` folder to find ready-to-use expressions with context and notes.
- Work through the exercises in the `labs/` folder to simulate how regex patterns behave with real content.
- Use this as a foundation to **integrate regex into your Microsoft Purview DLP**, PowerShell scripts, or cloud compliance policies.
