# Regular Expression (Regex) Library

Welcome to the **Regex Library** — a curated collection of regular expressions and hands-on labs developed to support **Microsoft Purview**, **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**, **sensitive data detection**, and broader **GRC use cases**.

This library is structured to help GRC professionals, Data Security Engineers, and Security Analysts **design, test, and implement** regex-based patterns for custom sensitive information types and real-world compliance workflows.
