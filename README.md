Welcome to my Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) portfolio.  

### 📚 Summary
Aspiring GRC Manager & Data Protection Engineer focused on risk governance, compliance frameworks, and data privacy within financial institutions. Currently pursuing CRISC, CISM, and Microsoft Purview certifications to deepen my expertise.

## 📚 GRC Overview

Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) is the integrated collection of capabilities that enable an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.

| **Governance** | Ensures alignment of IT/security initiatives with business goals, including policies, roles, and frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001).               |
| **Risk Mgmt.** | Identifies, assesses, and mitigates risks to critical assets — often through risk registers, assessments, KRIs, and POA&Ms.                        |
| **Compliance** | Ensures adherence to legal, regulatory, and policy obligations (e.g., HIPAA, SOX, PCI-DSS, FedRAMP). Supported by evidence collection, UARs, audits. |
