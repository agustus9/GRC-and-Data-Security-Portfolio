Welcome to my Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and Data Security Portfolio.  

### 📚 Summary

This portfolio showcases my dedication and expertise in risk governance, compliance frameworks, and data privacy and protection within organizations. It reflects my hands-on experience, ongoing projects, and commitment to strengthening security and regulatory adherence. Currently, I am enhancing my skills through certification and training in CRISK, CCSP, and Microsoft 365 Compliance Portal to further expand and demonstrate my capabilities in these specializations.

## 📚 GRC and Data Security Overview

Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) is a unified framework that enables organizations to achieve their objectives effectively while managing uncertainty and maintaining integrity. It encompasses the policies, procedures, and technologies designed to ensure that business operations align with regulatory requirements, mitigate risks, and uphold organizational standards.

**Data Security** is a critical component within the GRC framework, focusing on protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access, breaches, and data leakage. Effective data security measures support compliance efforts, reduce organizational risk exposure, and foster trust with customers and stakeholders.

By integrating GRC practices with robust data security strategies, organizations can create a resilient environment that not only adheres to industry standards ISO 27001, NIST, and PCI-DSS but also proactively defends against evolving cyber threats.
