# Arthur Mack – GRC Portfolio

Welcome to my Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) portfolio.  

## 🧭 GRC Overview

**Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** is the integrated collection of capabilities that enable an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Governance** | Ensures alignment of IT/security initiatives with business goals, including policies, roles, and frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001). |
| **Risk Management** | Identifies, assesses, and mitigates risks to critical assets — often through risk registers, assessments, KRIs, and POA&Ms. |
| **Compliance** | Ensures adherence to legal, regulatory, and policy obligations (e.g., HIPAA, SOX, PCI-DSS, FedRAMP). Supported by evidence collection, UARs, audits, and continuous monitoring. |

My portfolio demonstrates practical implementation of GRC across tools like **Microsoft Purview**, **Qualys**, and **ServiceNow**, using real-world policy and risk handling scenarios.

Here you'll find hands-on projects and documentation reflecting my work in:

- Risk Registers (NIST-mapped)
- Policy Lifecycle Governance
- Microsoft Purview DLP Configuration
- POA&M and Audit Management (Qualys to ServiceNow)
- Compliance Dashboards (Excel, Power BI)

## 📂 Portfolio Sections

### 📄 Policy Lifecycle Demonstration

A real-world simulation of the full policy lifecycle:
- ✅ Created an Acceptable Use Policy mapped to NIST SP 800-53 and ISO 27001
- 🔄 Ran through approval, staff distribution, implementation, and annual review
- 📊 Tracked exceptions and monitored control coverage via ServiceNow and Microsoft Purview

### 📊 Risk Register Template + Summary

This folder includes a structured and reusable Risk Register aligned with NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27005, and CIS Controls.

- ✅ `Risk_Register_Template.xlsx` – Editable Excel template with:
  - Likelihood × Impact heatmap scoring
  - Residual Risk calculation
  - Fields for Risk Owner, Mitigation, and Control Mapping
- ✅ `Risk_Register_Example.pdf` – A sample filled-out risk register for reference
- 🔐 Frameworks Used:
  - NIST CSF
  - ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Annex A
  - CIS Controls v8

🛠 Built and maintained by Arthur Mack as part of this GRC portfolio.

### 🔐 Microsoft Purview DLP Lab

Simulated a full data loss prevention lab using Microsoft Purview:
- 📦 Built policies to protect PII, PHI, and PCI across O365 apps
- 🧪 Used simulation mode to test policy behavior before enforcing
- ⚙️ Activated enforcement actions and tracked alerts
- 🎯 Integrated Adaptive Protection with user risk scoring

📁 [View PDF](./purview-lab/Microsoft_Purview_DLP_Lab.pdf)

### 🤝 Qualys–ServiceNow POA&M Integration Lab

Demonstrates automation of Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) workflows:
- 🔗 Triggered ServiceNow POA&M records from Qualys compliance scan failures
- 🛠 Mapped failed controls to CMDB Configuration Items (CIs)
- 🔄 Auto-assigned remediation deadlines with full lifecycle tracking
- 📊 Fed metadata into dashboards for audit and KPI reporting

📁 [View PDF](./qualys-servicenow-lab/Qualys_ServiceNow_POAM_Lab.pdf)

### 📊 Compliance Dashboard (Excel)

Sample Excel dashboard tracking compliance status by control category and asset. Useful for audit readiness, KPI reporting, and control failure monitoring.
