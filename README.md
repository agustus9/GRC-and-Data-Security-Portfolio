# Arthur Mack – GRC Portfolio

Welcome to my Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) portfolio.  

## 🧭 GRC Overview

**Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** is the integrated collection of capabilities that enable an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Governance** | Ensures alignment of IT/security initiatives with business goals, including policies, roles, and frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001). |
| **Risk Management** | Identifies, assesses, and mitigates risks to critical assets — often through risk registers, assessments, KRIs, and POA&Ms. |
| **Compliance** | Ensures adherence to legal, regulatory, and policy obligations (e.g., HIPAA, SOX, PCI-DSS, FedRAMP). Supported by evidence collection, UARs, audits, and continuous monitoring. |

My portfolio showcases the practical implementation of GRC across various tools, including **Microsoft Purview**, **Qualys**, and **ServiceNow**, utilizing real-world policy and risk management scenarios.
