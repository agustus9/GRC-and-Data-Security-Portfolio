- ✅ Created an Acceptable Use Policy mapped to NIST SP 800-53 and ISO 27001
- 🔄 Ran through approval, staff distribution, implementation, and annual review
- 📊 Tracked exceptions and monitored control coverage via ServiceNow and Microsoft Purview

### 🔐 Microsoft Purview DLP Lab

Simulated a full data loss prevention lab using Microsoft Purview:
- 📦 Built policies to protect PII, PHI, and PCI across O365 apps
- 🧪 Used simulation mode to test policy behavior before enforcing
- ⚙️ Activated enforcement actions and tracked alerts
- 🎯 Integrated Adaptive Protection with user risk scoring

### 🤝 Qualys–ServiceNow POA&M Integration Lab

Demonstrates automation of Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) workflows:
- 🔗 Triggered ServiceNow POA&M records from Qualys compliance scan failures
- 🛠 Mapped failed controls to CMDB Configuration Items (CIs)
- 🔄 Auto-assigned remediation deadlines with full lifecycle tracking
- 📊 Fed metadata into dashboards for audit and KPI reporting
