## 📚 GRC and Data Security Overview

Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) is a unified framework that enables organizations to achieve their objectives effectively while managing uncertainty and maintaining integrity. It encompasses the policies, procedures, and technologies designed to ensure that business operations align with regulatory requirements, mitigate risks, and uphold organizational standards.

**Data Security** is a critical component within the GRC framework, focusing on protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access, breaches, and data leakage. Effective data security measures support compliance efforts, reduce organizational risk exposure, and foster trust with customers and stakeholders.

By integrating GRC practices with robust data security strategies, organizations can create a resilient environment that not only adheres to industry standards like ISO 27001, NIST, and PCI-DSS but also proactively defends against evolving cyber threats.
