# **AI Security Implementation Plan**

## **Phase 1: Governance & Asset Management**

### Actions:
- **Establish AI Security Governance**
  - Assign a dedicated AI security officer or team.
  - Define roles, responsibilities, and accountability.
  - Develop policies aligning with organizational and regulatory requirements.
- **Inventory & Classify AI Assets**
  - Catalog all AI models, datasets, and infrastructure.
  - Document version history, ownership, and access controls.
  - Classify assets based on sensitivity and criticality.

### Controls:
- Maintain an **AI asset register**.
- Implement **access controls** based on least privilege.
- Define **acceptable use policies** for AI systems.

---

## **Phase 2: Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment**

### Actions:
- **Identify AI-specific threats**, such as:
  - Adversarial attacks (e.g., input manipulation).
  - Data poisoning.
  - Model theft or reverse engineering.
  - Bias and fairness issues.
- **Conduct risk assessments** to evaluate potential impact and likelihood.
- **Prioritize risks** based on business impact and exploitability.

### Controls:
- Use threat modeling tools customized for AI (like STRIDE for AI components).
- Perform **simulated attack scenarios** (red teaming).

---

## **Phase 3: Secure Development & Deployment**

### Actions:
- **Integrate security into the AI development lifecycle**:
  - Secure coding practices.
  - Data validation and sanitization.
  - Use adversarial testing to evaluate model robustness.
- **Implement model validation and explainability checks**.
- **Deploy using secure infrastructure** (e.g., container security, network segmentation).

### Controls:
- Code review for security vulnerabilities.
- Data integrity checks before training.
- Use **adversarial attack simulations** to test model robustness.
- Enforce **version control and rollback mechanisms**.

---

## **Phase 4: Data & Model Security**

### Actions:
- **Protect training and inference data**:
  - Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
  - Apply anonymization or differential privacy.
- **Secure model storage and access**:
  - Use hardware security modules (HSMs) or encrypted storage.
  - Limit access with multi-factor authentication.
- **Embed watermarks or fingerprints** in models to detect theft.

### Controls:
- Data access logs.
- Regular vulnerability scans of data repositories.
- Model integrity verification tools.

---

## **Phase 5: Monitoring & Incident Response**

### Actions:
- **Implement continuous monitoring**:
  - Detect anomalies in model outputs.
  - Monitor for unusual access or modification patterns.
- **Set up alerts for adversarial or poisoning signs**.
- **Develop an AI-specific incident response plan**:
  - Define procedures for suspected model compromise.
  - Establish communication protocols.

### Controls:
- Deploy AI monitoring tools with anomaly detection.
- Maintain logs of all model interactions.
- Regularly test incident response plans.

---

## **Phase 6: Validation, Auditing & Compliance**

### Actions:
- **Regularly audit AI systems**:
  - Verify adherence to policies.
  - Assess model fairness and bias.
- **Perform penetration testing** on AI components.
- **Document all processes, changes, and incidents**.

### Controls:
- Maintain audit trails.
- Conduct third-party reviews and certifications.
- Update risk assessments periodically.
