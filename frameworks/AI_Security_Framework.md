# AI Security Framework
| Category                     | Component                                | Key Practices & Focus                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Governance & Policy**      | Policies, Regulations & Standards       | Align AI with business objectives, regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), ethical standards, and internal privacy policies. Develop clear acceptable use policies, establish formal review processes for third-party AI tools, and define standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the entire model lifecycle (training, testing, deployment, retirement). |
| **Asset Management**         | Asset Catalog & Versioning              | Identify and document all AI assets (models, datasets, servers, tools) for visibility and change tracking. Ensure a comprehensive inventory of AI components for effective security management and rapid incident response. Prevent "Shadow AI" where unauthorized or unmonitored AI tools can introduce significant risks. |
| **Threat Modeling**          | Threats & Vulnerabilities               | Proactively identify potential threats and vulnerabilities specific to AI systems (e.g., adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model theft). Focus on understanding attack vectors specific to machine learning and AI workloads. Utilize frameworks like MITRE ATLASâ„¢ and OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model (LLM) security, according to Wiz. |
| **Secure Development & Deployment** | Secure Coding, Validation, Testing Adversarial Risks | Integrate security practices throughout the AI development lifecycle and strengthen AI models against various threats. Practices include secure coding, robust data validation, adversarial training (exposing models to malicious examples to improve resistance), and regular security testing (including adversarial simulations and red teaming) to uncover vulnerabilities. |
| **Monitoring & Incident Response** | Anomaly Detection, Response Plans | Continuously monitor AI systems for anomalies and effectively detect and respond to security incidents. Rapidly detect and mitigate security risks. Deploy automated AI risk detection, establish AI-focused incident response procedures, and implement platform-specific monitoring strategies. This aligns with Google's Secure AI Framework (SAIF). |
| **Data & Model Security**    | Encryption, Privacy, Watermarking       | Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data and models. Practices include encrypting data at rest and in transit, implementing privacy-enhancing techniques (e.g., differential privacy, federated learning), and using watermarking to track and verify models. |
| **Access Control & Identity Management** | Access Policies, Monitoring, Restricted Access | Establish clear access policies and controls to restrict interactions with AI systems and data. Practices include role-based access control (RBAC), the principle of least privilege, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and audit trails and logging to monitor and detect suspicious activity. |
| **Validation & Audit**         | Regular Testing                         | Periodically evaluate AI models and systems to identify vulnerabilities and ensure continued security effectiveness. Adapt to evolving AI models, usage patterns, and threat landscapes. Practices include regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing. |
| **Compliance & Reporting**     | Audit Logs, Reports                     | Ensure adherence to relevant regulations and standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Maintain detailed audit logs of AI processing activities, generate reports for regulatory bodies, and proactively identify and address compliance gaps, according to TechTarget. |
