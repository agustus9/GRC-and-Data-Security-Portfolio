# NIST SP 800-53 – Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems

NIST Special Publication 800-53 is a comprehensive framework developed by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**. It provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for all U.S. federal information systems, except those related to national security.

---

## Purpose
To protect federal information systems and organizations from diverse threats by implementing standardized controls that support:
- Risk management
- Security automation
- Continuous monitoring
- Privacy engineering

---

## Control Families
NIST 800-53 organizes its controls into **20 control families**, including:

| Family | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| AC     | Access Control |
| AU     | Audit and Accountability |
| CM     | Configuration Management |
| CP     | Contingency Planning |
| IA     | Identification and Authentication |
| IR     | Incident Response |
| MA     | Maintenance |
| MP     | Media Protection |
| PE     | Physical and Environmental Protection |
| PL     | Planning |
| PS     | Personnel Security |
| RA     | Risk Assessment |
| SA     | System and Services Acquisition |
| SC     | System and Communications Protection |
| SI     | System and Information Integrity |
| PM     | Program Management |
| SR     | Supply Chain Risk Management |
| PT     | Privacy Controls |
| AR     | Authority and Accountability (Privacy) |
| TR     | Transparency (Privacy) |

---

## Control Types
- **Common controls** – Inherited across multiple systems
- **System-specific controls** – Unique to a particular system
- **Hybrid controls** – A mix of common and system-specific

---

## Implementation Tiers
Controls are implemented based on the **impact level** (FIPS 199):
- Low
- Moderate
- High

Each level defines control strength and coverage, tied to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA).

---

## How It’s Used
- Required for U.S. federal agencies and contractors
- Mapped to other frameworks: ISO 27001, CIS Controls, FedRAMP, etc.
- Forms the foundation of the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**

---

## Updates
- **Current version**: Revision 5
- Emphasizes privacy, supply chain, and control baselines
- Future versions will focus more on automation and threat modeling

---

## Tools That Support NIST 800-53
- **Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL)**
- **eMASS** (Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service)
- **Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)**
- **Splunk**, **Qualys**, **ServiceNow GRC**

---

## Certification and Compliance
While NIST 800-53 isn’t a certifiable standard itself, it’s often:
- Required by government contracts (e.g., FedRAMP, CMMC)
- Used in audits and assessments for risk-based decisions
