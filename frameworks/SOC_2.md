# SOC 2 – Service Organization Control 2

SOC 2 is a voluntary compliance standard developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA), specifically designed for service providers storing customer data in the cloud. It evaluates how a company manages data based on five **Trust Services Criteria (TSC)**.

## Trust Services Criteria (TSC)
1. **Security** – Protection against unauthorized access (required for all SOC 2 reports)
2. **Availability** – System availability as agreed in SLAs
3. **Processing Integrity** – Complete, valid, and timely data processing
4. **Confidentiality** – Protection of confidential data
5. **Privacy** – Protection of personal identifiable information (PII)

## Types of SOC 2 Reports
- **Type I** – Describes a vendor’s systems and whether they meet relevant trust principles at a point in time.
- **Type II** – Details the operational effectiveness of a vendor’s systems over a defined period (typically 3–12 months).

## Implementation Steps
1. Define scope and applicable TSCs
2. Conduct a readiness assessment
3. Establish and document security controls
4. Remediate gaps found in readiness review
5. Undergo audit with licensed CPA firm
6. Maintain ongoing compliance with continuous monitoring
