# üßæ Policy Lifecycle Governance Demo

This lab-style demo illustrates how organizations manage the full lifecycle of an information security policy, from creation to retirement, aligned with GRC principles and compliance requirements.

---

## üìå Objectives

- Demonstrate the lifecycle of a security policy in a GRC context.
- Simulate version control, stakeholder reviews, and periodic updates.
- Align policy stages to ISO 27001:2022 and NIST CSF best practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Phases of the Policy Lifecycle

### 1. **Policy Drafting**
- Define scope, objective, ownership, and control mappings.
- Use a baseline template aligned with ISO/NIST/SOC 2 frameworks.
- Collaborate with SMEs and stakeholders (IT, Legal, HR, Risk).

### 2. **Policy Review & Approval**
- Route policy for review using a workflow (e.g., ServiceNow GRC or manual sign-offs).
- Incorporate legal/regulatory feedback.
- Finalize and publish v1.0 in SharePoint, Confluence, or GRC tool.

### 3. **Policy Distribution & Awareness**
- Communicate via email, LMS, and team briefings.
- Log acknowledgments if policy acceptance is required (for ISO, SOC 2, PCI).

### 4. **Policy Monitoring**
- Track enforcement via audits, compliance scans, or DLP systems (e.g., Microsoft Purview).
- Monitor violations, exceptions, and change requests.

### 5. **Policy Review / Update**
- Conduct annual or biennial reviews.
- Record version control and change history.
- Align with new regulatory or business changes.

### 6. **Policy Retirement**
- Archive policy.
- Communicate retirement and provide successor policy if applicable.
- Retain records for audit purposes (typically 3‚Äì7 years depending on industry).

## üß† Example Scenario

A **Data Classification Policy** was implemented in 2022 to comply with ISO 27001 A.5.12 and NIST PR.IP-1. Following a DLP incident in Q3 2023, the policy was revised to include stricter access controls and re-issued as v1.2 in January 2024.
