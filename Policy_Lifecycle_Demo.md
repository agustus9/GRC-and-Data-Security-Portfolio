# üìÑ Policy Lifecycle Governance Demo

This demo outlines how security policies are governed, tracked, and revised throughout their lifecycle within a GRC framework. The lifecycle ensures policies remain relevant, effective, and compliant with industry and organizational standards.

## üõ†Ô∏è Stages of the Policy Lifecycle

### 1. **Policy Creation**
- Drafted based on regulatory requirements (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001, HIPAA).
- Involves stakeholders such as security, compliance, legal, and business units.

### 2. **Review and Approval**
- Policies undergo formal review by GRC or compliance team.
- Reviewed for clarity, scope, enforcement potential, and business alignment.
- Approved by policy owners, risk officers, or steering committees.

### 3. **Publication and Communication**
- Policies are published in a central repository (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint).
- Communicated through awareness training, onboarding, or direct manager briefings.

### 4. **Implementation**
- Enforcement via technical controls (e.g., DLP, SIEM alerts, firewall rules).
- Integrated into SOPs, ticket workflows (e.g., ServiceNow), and audits.

### 5. **Monitoring and Enforcement**
- Policy compliance monitored via tools like Qualys PC, ServiceNow, and SCCM.
- Exceptions tracked, noncompliance logged, and incidents triaged.

### 6. **Periodic Review and Updates**
- Policies are reviewed annually (or semi-annually) for effectiveness.
- Changes due to regulatory shifts, risk appetite changes, or audit findings.

### 7. **Archiving or Retiring**
- Outdated policies are archived with a reason for deprecation.
- New version control maintained in the repository.
