# üõ°Ô∏è Policy Lifecycle Demo ‚Äì Arthur Mack's GRC Portfolio

## Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end lifecycle of an information security policy. It simulates how organizations draft, review, approve, implement, monitor, and retire policies within a GRC framework, aligned with ISO 27001 and NIST standards.

## üìã Policy Lifecycle Stages

1. **Policy Drafting**
   - Created an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) template based on ISO/IEC 27002 guidance.
   - Defined scope, audience, responsible stakeholders, and enforcement language.

2. **Review & Stakeholder Alignment**
   - Simulated review rounds with Legal, HR, IT Security, and Executive teams.
   - Created mock comments and tracked policy revisions.

3. **Approval & Publication**
   - Included metadata fields: versioning, approval date, and review schedule.
   - Created a mock approval flow with a sample sign-off sheet.

4. **Implementation**
   - Designed a rollout checklist: email notification, user training steps, and HR onboarding inclusion.
   - Created a sample tracking log for policy attestation.

5. **Monitoring & Exceptions**
   - Mocked a policy exception request form (to be logged via ServiceNow).
   - Created monitoring KPIs such as policy violations, exception volume, and control alignment.

6. **Retirement / Version Update**
   - Defined retirement triggers: tech changes, audit findings, regulatory updates.
   - Archived policy and linked to the new updated version.

## üìÇ Files Included

- `Policy_Lifecycle_Demo.pdf`: Visual walkthrough of the policy lifecycle.
- `Policy_Template_ISO_27001.docx`: Editable sample policy.
- `Policy_Exception_Form_SAMPLE.docx`: Sample form used for exception handling.
