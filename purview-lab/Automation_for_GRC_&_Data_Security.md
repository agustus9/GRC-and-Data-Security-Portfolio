# Automation for GRC & Data Security

This section consolidates scripts, tutorials, and resources to automate Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and Data Security processes using Python and PowerShell. These resources aim to streamline compliance, risk management, vulnerability assessments, and security operations.

### Python & PowerShell for GRC & Data Security
- Automate Vulnerability Scanning: Script to parse output from tools like Nessus or OpenVAS, generating compliance reports.
- Policy Compliance Checks: Script that scans configurations or files to verify adherence to data security policies (e.g., encryption, access controls).

# Python & PowerShell script
echo "# Example vulnerability scan parser" > Automation-GRC-DataSecurity/Python-for-Cybersecurity/Example1-AutomatedVulnerabilityScanning.py

echo "# Example: List AD users with admin privileges" > Automation-GRC-DataSecurity/PowerShell-for-Security-Professionals/Example1-AutomatedUserAccessAudit.ps1

**Example snippet:**
```python
import json

# Example: Parse vulnerability scan report and highlight high-risk issues
with open('scan_report.json') as f:
    report = json.load(f)

high_risks = [issue for issue in report['issues'] if issue['severity'] == 'High']
print(f"High-risk vulnerabilities found: {len(high_risks)}")
for vuln in high_risks:
    print(f"- {vuln['title']} at {vuln['host']}")

```powershell
# Your PowerShell code here
# For example:
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" | Select-Object Name, SamAccountName
